I lead the [YODA Lab](http://yeoh-lab.wustl.edu/), where we use artificial intelligence based techniques to develop intelligent agent-based systems. Our recent research focus is on the exciting area of human-AI teaming and collaboration!

Prior to joining WashU, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at New Mexico State University; a research scientist in the Living Analytics Research Center at Singapore Management University; and a post-doctoral research associate with [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, supervised by [Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/), and my M.S. and B.S.E. in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics from the University of Pennsylvania, supervised by [Vijay Kumar](http://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~kumar/wiki/).

I am an associate professor in computer science and engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, where I lead the [YODA Lab](http://yeoh-lab.wustl.edu/). I also direct the [Division of Computational and Data Sciences](https://datasciences.wustl.edu/), a new inter-disciplinary PhD program spanning the Computer Science and Engineering department, the Brown School of Social Work and Public Health, and the Political Science and Psychology and Brain Sciences departments in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
